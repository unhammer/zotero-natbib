This is a slight change to the standard Zotero BibTeX exporter in
order to work better with natbib. I am using it with these patched
versions of [[http://github.com/unhammer/writer2latex][Writer2LaTeX]] and [[http://github.com/unhammer/lyz][LyZ]].

To use it:

- Download BibTeX-natbib.js and put it in your zotero/translators
  directory.  On my system this is
  =~/.mozilla/firefox/bi3xapi2.default/zotero/translators= (you can
  also choose to store your Zotero folder somewhere else, in the
  Zotero "advanced" settings)
- Restart Firefox. When you got to export, you’ll see it offered as a
  possibility.
